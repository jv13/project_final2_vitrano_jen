##Resources
###Images from Protoype & Style Tile:
* [Photos of Pizza Planet](http://pixar.wikia.com/wiki/Pizza_Planet): The photo of the outside, and interior (including alien slime drink photo) of Pizza Planet was used from this website.
* [Style Tile textures](http://pixar.wikia.com/wiki/Pizza_Planet): The textures present in the style tile png were taken from 2 photos from this website. The starts and orange planet texture were taken from the interior of Pizza Planet arcade photo.  The last with the circles and metal pole was take from the Entrance to Pizza Planet photo.
* [Pizza Planet Logo:](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/48/68/cc/4868ccfb4af044916b649961af577dfa.jpg) The image for the logo was taken from this site.  I then repurposed it in Photoshop to include different colors, displayed it horizontally, and added a border background to it.
* [Alien Cutout:](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/a1/15/ce/a115ce1309b7f9a4cc4c849eee64bede.jpg) I used this link to copy the image of the alien into photoshop.  I then removed all od the inside lines creating just the outline and colored him to the different possible colors I wanted.  A white filled copy was also used behind so that the possible colors did not blend directly into the background.
* [Rocket Cutout](http://cliparts.co/rocket-ship-outline): I used the first rocket ship from the website and copied it into Photoshop, once again I removed all of the inner lines leaving just the outline.  It was then filled in with white. This was then enlarged and used a the background as to not have the patterns blend in with the dark background color.  Another copy was used by creating a clipping mask with the texture image.
* [Saturn Cutout:](http://images.clipartpanda.com/saturn-clipart-black-and-white-ycooXAgcE.png) The saturn cutout was taken from this page and was taken to Photoshop to be filled in with a low blue color.  The opacity was then changed and placed in the background of the style tile to add dimension.  This shapre was also used in the top right corner of the style tile to house the version and title of the png.
* [Star Border:](http://pixar.wikia.com/wiki/Pizza_Planet) The photo of the outside of Pizza Planet was cropped and the top half of the sky was used to create a border for the style tile and as the header of the prototype.

###Fonts:
* [Sub Header- "A Space":](http://www.dafont.com/a-space.font?text=Pizza+Planet)This font was used for the subheader, it was chosen because it reminded me of font that would be used because it has a galactic feel.
* [Header - "Space Ranger":](http://www.dafont.com/space-ranger.font?text=Pizza+Planet) Space Ranger is the header font that was chosen for this site.  It has a "space" feel and reminds me of the font seen in the photos of the inside and outside of Pizza Planet from the movie.
* [Paragraph & Links - Euphemia]("http://www.fontpalace.com/font-details/Euphemia/) The paragraph and link fonts were used from this site.  They have a rounded appeal that match that of the header and sub header.

###Buttons:
* [Button Hover Effect:](http://tympanus.net/Development/CreativeButtons/) The button hover effect was inspired by this website.  It models the hover effect of the "red" section (more specifically 2nd coloumn 4th row).  The source code was downloaded from this site, and then I took away anything I did not need to compelete the effect.  The colors and sizing were also changed to match the color scheme of Pizza Planet.

###Stlye Tile:
* [Stlye Tile Layout:](http://styletil.es/) The layout that I used when creating the Pizza Planet style tile.  Although I changed all of the shapes and colors, the sections remained the same.

###Prototype Layout:
* [Sparkbox:](http://tympanus.net/Development/CreativeButtons/) This website was used as inspiration for the Pizza Planet prototype.  The elements are placed in relation to this example.

##Comments
* The was the first responsive site that I tried without referencing the video or following along at the same time as I did with the previous assignment. Because of that I decided to emulate the layout based off of the templates shown for the style tyle and prototype rather than create my own.
* Positioning the aliens was the hardest aspect of this project.
* The drink image is 2px smaller height wise than the inside of the arcade.  I tried altering the dimensions in Photoshop but nothing that I did worked and I did not want to have to call each image to resize it or declare a set height.
* The font colors also gave me some trouble since this is such a dark background website. I know white can be hard to read sometimes, but no other color made sense.  I tried to used a lighter background color for the text content so that everything doesn't blend in so much.  I kept the link text red because high imporatance items in arcade games or in space flash in red text.
* I had alot of fun creating the style tile and think this is a great tool to use instead of mock-ups.
* I am worried that for the final "part 3" of this series I am going to in the end decide to change the font colors based on the content that is needed.
